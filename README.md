# HeartDiseasePrediction
Implement the Prediction of the Heart disease using Machine Learning. Considering the Support Vector Machine algorithm it was possible to predict the Presence or absence of heart disease.
SVM model is trained on dataset of various health factors such as Age, Sex, Blood pressure, Cholestrol, etc.
This model was trained using Sklearn as well as Tensorflow 2.0, to verify the difference between the results using both of them.
